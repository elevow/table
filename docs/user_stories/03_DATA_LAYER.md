- Handle avatar data

**Technical Notes:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    bankroll DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    stats JSONB
);
```

### US-010: Game History Recording
As a system,
I want to record detailed game history,
So that we can support replay and analysis features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Record all game actions
- Store hand results
- Support efficient querying
- Handle large data volumes

**Technical Notes:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    table_id UUID NOT NULL,
    hand_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action_sequence JSONB NOT NULL,
    community_cards TEXT[],
    results JSONB NOT NULL,
    started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
);
```

## Data Access Layer

### US-011: Efficient Data Retrieval
As a system,
I want to optimize data access patterns,
So that we can maintain low latency under load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement caching strategy
- Optimize common queries
- Handle concurrent access
- Monitor performance

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface CacheConfig {
  strategy: 'write-through' | 'write-behind';
  ttl: number;
  maxSize: number;
  invalidationRules: InvalidationRule[];
}

interface QueryOptimization {
  indexing: string[];
  partitioning: PartitionStrategy;
  materializedViews: string[];
}
```

### US-012: Data Consistency
As a system,
I want to maintain data consistency across operations,
So that we can prevent data corruption and race conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement transaction management
- Handle concurrent modifications
- Ensure ACID properties
- Provide conflict resolution

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface TransactionConfig {
  isolationLevel: 'read_committed' | 'repeatable_read' | 'serializable';
  timeout: number;
  retryPolicy: RetryStrategy;
}
```

## Data Migration

### US-013: Schema Evolution
As a developer,
I want to safely evolve the database schema,
So that we can add new features without disruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Zero-downtime migrations
- Backward compatibility
- Data validation
- Rollback capability

**Technical Notes:**
```sql
-- Migration template
CREATE MIGRATION {version} TO {target} {
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
    ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS feature_flags JSONB;
    -- ... additional migration steps
}
```

## Data Security

### US-014: Data Protection
As a system administrator,
I want to ensure sensitive data is protected,
So that we comply with privacy regulations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement access controls
- Audit data access
- Support data retention policies

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface SecurityConfig {
  encryption: {
    algorithm: string;
    keyRotation: number;
    saltRounds: number;
  };
  access: {
    roles: string[];
    permissions: Map<string, string[]>;
  };
  audit: {
    enabled: boolean;
    retention: number;
  };
}
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### US-015: Performance Monitoring
As a system administrator,
I want to monitor database performance,
So that we can identify and resolve issues quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Track query performance
- Monitor resource usage
- Alert on anomalies
- Generate performance reports

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface DBMetrics {
  queryStats: {
    avg_execution_time: number;
    cache_hit_ratio: number;
    slow_queries: number;
  };
  resources: {
    connections: number;
    disk_usage: number;
    cpu_usage: number;
  };
  alerts: Alert[];
}
```

### US-016: Analytics Support
As a business analyst,
I want to extract meaningful insights from game data,
So that we can improve the player experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Define key metrics
- Build analytics views
- Support custom reporting
- Enable data export

**Technical Notes:**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW player_statistics AS
SELECT
    player_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT hand_id) as hands_played,
    AVG(profit_loss) as average_profit,
    percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY profit_loss) as median_profit
FROM game_results
GROUP BY player_id;
```
