# Version Manager Refactoring

This document explains the refactoring of the `VersionManager` component to improve testability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Background

The original `VersionManager` class was directly extending `StateManager`, which created tight coupling and made it difficult to test in isolation due to dependencies on other managers like `SyncManager`, `OptimisticManager`, etc.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Dependency Injection**: Replace hardcoded dependencies with injected dependencies
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Extract core version management logic into a separate class
3. **Interface-Based Design**: Define clear interfaces for all dependencies

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Interfaces

We created the following interfaces in `version-interfaces.ts`:

- `IChecksumProvider`: For generating checksums from data
- `ITimeProvider`: For getting timestamps
- `IVersionCounter`: For managing version numbers
- `IVersionHistoryManager`: For core version history management

### 2. Extracted Core Logic

We extracted the core versioning logic into a standalone `VersionHistoryManager` class that:

- Doesn't depend on `StateManager`
- Implements the `IVersionHistoryManager` interface
- Accepts dependencies through constructor injection

### 3. Default Implementations

We created default implementations for all dependencies:

- `DefaultChecksumProvider`: Uses crypto to generate SHA-256 checksums
- `DefaultTimeProvider`: Uses Date.now() to get timestamps
- `DefaultVersionCounter`: Manages version numbers

### 4. Refactored VersionManager

The `VersionManager` was refactored to:

- Still extend `StateManager` for backward compatibility
- Accept dependencies through constructor injection
- Delegate core functionality to `VersionHistoryManager`

### 5. Updated Tests

We created comprehensive tests for both the original implementation (using mocks) and the new implementation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Testability**: Can test version management logic in isolation
- **Reduced Coupling**: Dependencies are explicit and can be swapped
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Core logic is independent of framework concerns
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create with default dependencies
const versionManager = new VersionManager(stateManagerConfig);

// Create with custom dependencies
const versionManager = new VersionManager(
  stateManagerConfig,
  100, // maxHistoryLength
  new CustomChecksumProvider(),
  new CustomTimeProvider(),
  new CustomVersionCounter()
);

// Or inject a completely custom version history manager
const versionManager = new VersionManager(
  stateManagerConfig,
  100,
  undefined,
  undefined,
  undefined,
  new CustomVersionHistoryManager()
);
```
