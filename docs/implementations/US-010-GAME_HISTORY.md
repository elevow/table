# US-010: Game History Recording Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for recording detailed game history as specified in US-010, enabling replay and analysis features with efficient querying capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GameHistoryManager** (`src/lib/database/game-history-manager.ts`)
   - Data access layer for game history operations
   - Handles database transactions and connection management
   - Provides efficient querying with filters and pagination
   - Supports analytics and cleanup operations

2. **GameHistoryService** (`src/lib/services/game-history-service.ts`)
   - Business logic layer for game history operations
   - Validates business rules and constraints
   - Provides clean API for application use

3. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/game-history.ts`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Ensures type safety across the application
   - Defines all data structures and request/response formats

4. **Database Schema** (`src/lib/database/migrations/010_game_history.sql`)
   - PostgreSQL tables optimized for large data volumes
   - Efficient indexes for common query patterns
   - JSONB storage for flexible action sequences and results

## Database Design

### Main Tables

#### `game_history`
- Stores complete game records as specified in US-010
- Uses JSONB for flexible action sequences and results
- Optimized with GIN indexes for JSON querying
- Includes comprehensive metadata (started_at, ended_at, etc.)

#### `player_actions`
- Normalized player actions for efficient analytics
- Enables fast player-specific queries
- Supports statistical analysis and reporting

### Indexes
- **Primary queries**: table_id, hand_id, date ranges
- **Player queries**: Player-specific action and result lookups
- **Analytics**: Pot amounts, winner counts, action types
- **JSON queries**: GIN indexes on action_sequence and results

## Key Features

### ✅ Record All Game Actions
- Complete action sequences with timestamps
- Player positions and hole cards
- Bet amounts and action types

### ✅ Store Hand Results
- Winner information with hand rankings
- Pot distribution (main/side pots)
- Rake calculations
- Community cards

### ✅ Efficient Querying
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Flexible filtering (date ranges, pot sizes, player counts)
- Player-specific history retrieval
- Table-specific analytics

### ✅ Large Data Volume Support
- Optimized database schema with proper indexing
- Cleanup utilities for old records
- Efficient JSON storage and querying
- Connection pooling and transaction management

## Usage Examples

### Recording Game History
```typescript
const gameHistoryService = new GameHistoryService(gameHistoryManager);

const gameRecord = await gameHistoryService.recordGame({
  tableId: 'table-123',
  handId: 'hand-456',
  actionSequence: [
    {
      playerId: 'player-1',
      action: 'bet',
      amount: 50,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      position: 1
    }
    // ... more actions
  ],
  communityCards: ['AH', 'KD', 'QC', '7S', '2H'],
  results: {
    winners: [{
      playerId: 'player-1',
      winAmount: 100,
      handRank: 'Two Pair'
      // ... more winner data
    }],
    totalPot: 100,
    rake: 5
  },
  startedAt: new Date(),
  endedAt: new Date()
});
```

### Querying Game History
```typescript
// Get recent games for a table
const recentGames = await gameHistoryService.searchGames(
  { 
    tableId: 'table-123',
    limit: 20,
    dateFrom: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // Last 24 hours
  },
  {
    minPot: 50 // Filter for significant pots
  }
);

// Get player-specific history
const playerHistory = await gameHistoryService.getPlayerHistory('player-123', {
  limit: 50,
  offset: 0
});
```

### Analytics
```typescript
// Get table analytics for the last month
const analytics = await gameHistoryService.getAnalytics(
  new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  new Date(),
  'table-123'
);

console.log({
  totalHands: analytics.totalHands,
  averagePot: analytics.averagePot,
  mostFrequentAction: analytics.mostFrequentAction
});
```
