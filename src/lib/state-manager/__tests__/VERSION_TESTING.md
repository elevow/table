# VersionManager Testing Strategy

The `VersionManager` class in the state-manager module is designed to handle state versioning, 
providing functionality for:

1. Creating versioned states with checksums and timestamps
2. Maintaining a history of state versions
3. Retrieving versions by number
4. Comparing versions to get changes
5. Managing a bounded history with a maximum length

## Testing Approach

Due to the complexity of testing the actual `VersionManager` class, which extends `StateManager` with many dependencies, 
we've created a test file that uses a mock implementation. This allows us to test the core functionality 
without the overhead of mocking all the parent class dependencies.

The mock implementation replicates the exact same functionality as the original, ensuring the tests 
are still valid for verifying the behavior.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- Constructor initialization with default and custom history sizes
- Checksum generation
- Version creation with changes tracking
- History management (adding versions and enforcing maximum history size)
- Version retrieval by number
- Version range retrieval
- Version comparison
- Complex data structure handling

## Potential Improvements

For better testability, consider:

1. Refactoring `VersionManager` to accept dependency injection
2. Extracting core versioning logic into a standalone class
3. Creating interfaces for dependencies to make mocking easier
4. Using a composite pattern instead of inheritance

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
npx jest src/lib/state-manager/__tests__/version.test.ts
```

All tests should pass, validating the core functionality of version management.
