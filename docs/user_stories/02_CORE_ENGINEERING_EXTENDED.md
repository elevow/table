  reconnectionDelay: number;
  timeout: number;
  pingInterval: number;
  transport: 'websocket' | 'polling';
}

interface ConnectionState {
  status: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting';
  lastPing: number;
  latency: number;
  transport: string;
}
```

### US-036: Event Broadcasting System
As a system architect,
I want to implement an efficient event broadcasting system,
So that game state updates can be delivered to all relevant clients.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support room-based broadcasting
- Implement message batching
- Handle message ordering
- Support binary protocols
- Implement load balancing

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface BroadcastConfig {
  batchSize: number;
  batchInterval: number;
  compression: boolean;
  priority: 'high' | 'normal' | 'low';
  targets: string[]; // room or user IDs
}

interface MessageBatch {
  sequence: number;
  timestamp: number;
  messages: GameEvent[];
  compression: 'none' | 'gzip' | 'binary';
}
```

## State Management

### US-037: Game State Machine
As a system architect,
I want to implement a robust state machine for game flow,
So that game rules are enforced consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Define all possible game states
- Implement state transitions
- Validate action legality
- Handle error states
- Support state recovery

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface GameStateMachine {
  currentState: GameState;
  allowedTransitions: Map<GameState, GameState[]>;
  validators: Map<GameState, ActionValidator[]>;
  history: StateTransition[];
  recovery: RecoveryPoint[];
}

interface StateTransition {
  from: GameState;
  to: GameState;
  trigger: GameAction;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### US-038: Client State Synchronization
As a system architect,
I want to ensure client and server states are synchronized,
So that all players see the same game state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement state versioning
- Handle conflict resolution
- Support state reconciliation
- Implement optimistic updates
- Handle race conditions

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface StateSynchronization {
  version: number;
  timestamp: number;
  checksum: string;
  delta: StateDelta;
  conflicts: StateConflict[];
}

interface StateConflict {
  clientVersion: number;
  serverVersion: number;
  conflictType: 'merge' | 'override';
  resolution: 'client' | 'server' | 'merge';
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### US-039: Code Loading Optimization
As a system architect,
I want to optimize code loading and execution,
So that the application starts up quickly and runs smoothly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement code splitting
- Setup route-based splitting
- Configure component lazy loading
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Setup dynamic imports

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface CodeSplitConfig {
  routes: RouteConfig[];
  components: ComponentConfig[];
  chunks: ChunkConfig[];
  prefetch: PrefetchRule[];
}

interface ChunkConfig {
  name: string;
  priority: number;
  prefetch: boolean;
  dependencies: string[];
}
```

### US-040: Caching Strategy
As a system architect,
I want to implement an effective caching strategy,
So that frequently accessed data is served quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement API response caching
- Setup static asset caching
- Configure state persistence
- Handle cache invalidation
- Support offline capabilities

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface CacheConfig {
  storage: 'memory' | 'redis' | 'local';
  ttl: number;
  maxSize: number;
  invalidationRules: InvalidationRule[];
}

interface CacheEntry {
  key: string;
  data: any;
  expires: number;
  tags: string[];
  version: number;
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### US-041: Application Metrics
As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive application metrics,
So that I can monitor system health and performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Track response times
- Monitor error rates
- Measure resource usage
- Collect user metrics
- Generate performance reports

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface ApplicationMetrics {
  performance: {
    responseTime: Histogram;
    latency: Histogram;
    throughput: Counter;
  };
  resources: {
    cpu: Gauge;
    memory: Gauge;
    connections: Gauge;
  };
  errors: {
    count: Counter;
    types: Record<string, number>;
  };
}
```

### US-042: Game Analytics
As a system administrator,
I want detailed game-related analytics,
So that I can understand game patterns and user behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Track room statistics
- Monitor player statistics
- Record action timing
- Analyze feature usage
- Generate trend reports

**Technical Notes:**
```typescript
interface GameAnalytics {
  rooms: {
    active: number;
    avgDuration: number;
    peakTimes: TimeDistribution;
  };
  players: {
    active: number;
    retention: RetentionMetrics;
    behavior: BehaviorMetrics;
  };
  features: {
    usage: FeatureUsageStats;
    performance: FeaturePerformance;
  };
}
```
